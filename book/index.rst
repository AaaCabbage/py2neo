======================
The Py2neo v3 Handbook
======================

Py2neo is a client library and comprehensive toolkit for working with Neo4j from within Python
applications and from the command line. The core library has no external dependencies and has been
carefully designed to be easy and intuitive to use.

The latest release of py2neo is **3b1**.

Py2neo is supported for the following versions of Python and Neo4j:

- Python 2.7 / 3.3 / 3.4 / 3.5
- Neo4j 2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2 / 2.3 / 3.0 (the latest point release of each version is recommended)

Note also that Py2neo is developed and tested exclusively under Linux using standard CPython distributions.
While other operating systems and Python distributions may work, I cannot offer support for those.
